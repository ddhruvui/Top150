# Safety net: terminate any leftover "investopediaclaude-*" pods (predict-market,
# predict-stage1, …) that failed to self-terminate. Lists pods via the account API and
# DELETEs each match. Run this when a pod was launched but never died — notably the
# broken-host case in the top150-pipeline skill (rule 4): no bootstrap log within ~5 min
# means it will bill forever while RUNNING and never start.
