#   1. vendor fetch (launch.sh all) + post (validate -> build_m1), which
#      self-sequences on today's vendor manifests
#   2. m1x whole-market update (resumable — re-parses current year only)
#   3. predict (continual: warm-updates stored champions; full refit on cadence)
#   4. mirror the report inputs off the volume
#   5. rebuild reports/latest for the console
#
# Everything is incremental on a warm volume, so a normal evening run is short.
