INCREMENTAL (default on; set "incremental": false in the config to force a full refetch). The
network volume persists DATA_DIR between RunPod launches, so the *append-only* streams — **news**
and **estimates** — read what's already on disk and only add new rows (news: rows dated on/after the
latest stored row, merged+deduped; estimates: one snapshot per pull day). Everything else refetches
in full: eod / dividends / splits / market are tiny AND EODHD rewrites `adjusted_close` retroactively
after a split/dividend so a naive append would go stale; fundamentals / universe / calendar / symbol
lists / earnings-calendar are point-in-time snapshots replaced whole.

Self-termination is bootstrap.sh's job, so this runs/tests locally:

    DATA_DIR=./out CONFIG_PATH=config/tickers.json EODHD_API_TOKEN=xxx STORE_LOGS=true python src/fetch.py

Logging (env-controlled): `_run.json` manifest is always written. A full run log
(`logs/run-<ts>.log`) is stored ONLY when `STORE_LOGS` is truthy. Failures (`logs/error-<ts>.log`)
and crashes (`logs/crash-<ts>.log`) are ALWAYS logged, regardless of `STORE_LOGS`.
Exit code: 0 if every job succeeded, 1 otherwise.

    per-ticker loop advances, so whichever of {fundamentals, estimates} runs first pays, the other
    is free, and the order in `datasets` stops mattering.

    v1.1, NOT v1 — this is a correctness fix, not a version bump. The v1 endpoint returns
    `Earnings::Trend` as one flat date-keyed map, so a company's fiscal-Q4 row and its ANNUAL row
    share a key and the annual value wins. AAPL's Sep-2017 quarterly estimate is 1.87; v1 reports
    9.00 there, the FY number, ~5x too high, silently. 10 of AAPL's 39 quarterly periods are
    corrupted this way — every fiscal Q4 since 2017. v1.1 nests the block as
    {Quarterly: {...}, Annual: {...}} and returns 39 + 11 = 50 rows where v1 returns 40.
    Verified live 2026-08-17: every other top-level block is byte-identical between the two
    versions (13 keys, no field differences), so this costs nothing and breaks no other consumer."""
